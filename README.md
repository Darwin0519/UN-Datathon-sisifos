## Methodology

The project began with an analysis of positive factors (green areas, educational institutions, waterways, tourist attractions, quality of life indices) and negative factors (thefts, violence, illicit substance consumption, gentrification) in Medellín. Temporal trends and spatial distributions were examined, along with correlations between these variables.

Several AI models were developed:

- **Prediction of Tourist Arrivals**
- **Sentiment Analysis on Tourism** among residents
- **Incident Reporting Mechanisms** for safety concerns
- **Gentrification Trend Prediction** based on local characteristics

## Deliverables

A final presentation video was created to showcase the project's outcomes and recommendations.
